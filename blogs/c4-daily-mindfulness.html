                <h1>Daily mindfulness</h1>
                <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindful conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
                <p>Mindful conversation consists of: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        listening mindfully to the other person,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        looping, which means closing the loop of communication by demonstrating that you have really heard what the person is saying
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        dipping, that is checking in with yourself, knowing how you are feeling about what you are hearing
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I haven't done this formally but tried it informally in daily work situations. It feels like something that we all should
                    do and to a degree a lot of people around me seem to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is nice to know the other person is listening intently and really hearing you. Repeating things back is extremely helpful
                    to avoid conflicts that arise from simple misunderstandings. I think dipping is definitely the hardest
                    part of mindful conversation.
                </p>


                <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
                <p>
                    I like the idea of alternating between focused and open attention during meditation, I have used it during practice and will
                    hopefully keep it up to sustain my practice.
                </p>
                <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think walking medition sounds like an interesting concept that I might try.
