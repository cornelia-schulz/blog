                <h1>Meditation process</h1>
                <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
                <p>
                    When looking at the task of redesigning my blog, I briefly considered using Bootstrap because it makes it very intuitive
                    to create nice design. I know I'm not a designer and my wireframes more than reflect that but I enjoyed
                    going through the process of scribbling down some boxes and then using Skeleton making it look remotely
                    like those wireframes. I probably swore more than a lot at the CSS because things just did not beahve
                    like I expected them to. But it was all good fun and I really had to drag myself away from the designing
                    and getting it perfect bit in the end.
                </p>
                <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2 of "Search inside yourself" ?</h3>
                <p>When I think of meditation, I immediately think of yoga, deep breath and relaxation. I believe it helps to
                    clear your mind and tackle anything that's thrown your way.</p>
                <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
                <p>Mindful meditation is all about paying attention where your attention wanders and then bring it back to where
                    you want it to be. Once you can do this on demand, it will lead to calmness, clarity and happiness.
                </p>
                <p>Meditation is like exercise for the mind. For example, if you do a lot of meditation exercises, your mind
                    becomes calmer and more perceptive, you can focus your attention more strongly and for longer, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>You can meditate in any position that makes you feel both relaxed and alert.</p>
                <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
                <p>I think the practice of focusing on your breath and bringing your attention back to it whenever it wanders
                    appeals to me and I might give it a go.
                </p>
                <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
