        <h1>Self confidence</h1>
        <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
        <p>Self-awareness: is being able to look at your emotions in a neutral way even in the midst of emotionally challenging
          situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mindfulness: is being able to focus your attention on a particular purpose or moment in time neutrally and simply observe.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two things are very closely related if not one and the same. Being mindful and self aware will lead to a more accurate
          self-assessment and that in turn will lead to more self-confidence, so we can take life in our stride!.
        </p>
        <h3>Body scan</h3>
        <p>
          Body scan is a technique where you sit or lie comfortably and then focus on each part of your body and observe any problems
          or are simply aware of them. Start from the top of your head and work your way down, giving yourself time for each
          part. This technique can last from a few minutes to quite a long time. You decide!
        </p>
        <p>
          When trying this technique I found it incredible how by just giving a body part our full attention for a few moments that
          part of the body became so relaxed and that a lot of tensions we build up during the day can simply be relieved.
          It is an easy exercise that I'd recommend anyone to try!
        </p>
        <h3>My emotions are not me...</h3>
        <p>
          In everyday life, it is so easy to lose yourself in your emotions and let yourself be carried by them. BUT: we are not our
          emotions!
        </p>
        <p>
          With enough mindfulness practice, we will hopefully experience a very important shift towards being able to look at our emotions
          in a more objective way and understanding that we are in control of them rather than the opposite way round. Just
          like clouds in the sky, our emotions are a phenomena in our mind and body that simply come and go.
