        <h3>Insight and techniques for growing trust</h3>
        <p>
          Trust is extremely important in any relationship, be it personal or work related. It is very hard to work or interact with
          anybody you don't trust. To be able to open up to someone and have good conversations you need to know that you
          can trust that person, so you can have friendly arguments in order to resolve anything. Some techniques to gain
          trust are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be sincere</li>
          <li>Kindness</li>
          <li>Openness</li>
          <li>Empathic listening</li>
          <li>Praise</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I believe I have used all of the above techniques for growing trust to build better relationships. They all work and it generally
          depends on the other person on which technique or better what combination of techniques will work best.
        </p>

        <h3>Empathic listening</h3>
        <p>
          To actively use the empathic listening technique, it helps to fall back onto mindfulness and kindness. To practice empathic
          listening, listen out for the other person's feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried this exercise with a friend and found it very interesting, especially when you don't agree with the other person.
          But sometimes it helps a lot to understand what the other person's perspective on an issue is and what they feel
          about this issue to be able to resolve a potential conflict.
        </p>
        <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
        <p>
          I found this meditation to be very calming. It was good to actively think about that one person because life can be hectic
          at times and it's good to take a time out to think of the people around us who we care about.
        </p>

        <h3>Political awareness exercise</h3>
        <p>
          My view: In one of the jobs I worked at, my manager was promoted and hired a new manager for our team who in turn promoted
          one of my team members as team lead. This team lead had in no way proved as a team player or even technically competent
          in the past, the team member was simply the old manager's pet. And when the team questioned the decision, the manager
          just slammed a fist on the table saying that the decision had been made and we are not there to question this decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other view: As the hiring manager was new, this manager simply listened to recommendations from the predecessor.
