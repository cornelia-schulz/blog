                <h1>Leadership</h1>
                <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
                <p>Over time I have met quite a few team leads who all had different leadership styles. In the more recent past
                    I have come across a number of very caring or compassionate team leads and it was a lot more easy to
                    connect to them because you'd know they expect so much from you but would listen to various concerns
                    within the team. They'd not quite be your friend outside work but as close to one as possible.
                </p>
                <p>It's much easier to work with a leader that has your trust and your respect.</p>
                <h3>Multiplying goodness meditation</h3>
                <p>
                    Breathe in goodness, multiply it by ten in your heart and breathe out more goodness. Feel the goodness of others around you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried the multiplying goodness meditation and must admit it did not do much for me. My mind kept wandering off wanting
                    to follow the bright white light. I will give it another try though.
                </p>
                <h3>Tonglen meditation</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine you are a mountain and you see the world from an elevated point of view. Then imagine sitting opposite yourself,
                    breathe in the pain of whatever has been troubling you lately. Turn it to goodness in your heart and
                    breathe out the goodness. Then move on to other people. Breathe in their pain and turn it into goodness
                    in your heart. Breathe out goodness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really like the idea of this meditation. I have tried it only once so far and it definitely needs a lot more practice than
                    that.
                </p>
                <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>
                    SCARF stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness. You can influence people most effectively when you
                    help them achieve what they want in a way that also helps you and simultaneously serves greater good.
                    By understanding the social brain, you can better understand how your actions can increase the SCARF
                    factors for yourself and others. Once you master that you can find ways to help people in ways that also
                    align with your own interests and create win-win situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked mostly on my own in Phase 0 but I think some of the things we learned in these early sprints will definitely
                    help with self confidence because we are building a solid foundation to work from.

                </p>
                <p>Understanding the social brain will be an invaluable skill to have when working closely with others, especially
                    because bootcamp is a fairly short time to cram a lot of knowledge and projects into. By knowing how
                    to best work with all kinds of personalities this should hopefully be smooth sailing.
                </p>
                <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Walk through three conversations ("What happened?", "What emotions are involved", "What does this say
                        about me?"</li>
                    <li>Decide whether to raise the issue</li>
                    <li>Start from the objective third story</li>
                    <li>Explore their story and yours</li>
                    <li>Problem solve</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Having difficult conversations is really hard but the good thing is once you know what you want to communicate
                    and you have brought an issue up, you often feel a lot better, especially if the conversation went well.
                    I guess my last difficult conversation was pitching my idea of coming to Dev Academy and why this will
                    be good for both my own development as well as for the company. The conversations went well and I am
                    glad I made the pitch.
                </p>
